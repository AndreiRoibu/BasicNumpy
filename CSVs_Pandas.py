'''CSVs with Pandas

Author: Andrei-Claudiu Roibu, 2019

This code has been created to compare the speed difference between a numpy dot product and a slow dot product. This code was written in support of my learning.

The original code comes from these two sources:

Description:

This code uses previously generated datasets, and saves them as a CSV, with headers, using the Pandas library.
