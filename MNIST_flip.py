'''MNIST flip

Author: Andrei-Claudiu Roibu, 2019

This code has been created to compare the speed difference between a numpy dot product and a slow dot product. This code was written in support of my learning.

The original code comes from these two sources:

Description:

This code loads the MNIST data set, found at this link: https://www.kaggle.com/c/digit-recognizer/data 

This code contains a function that flips an image 90 degrees clockwise, using both for loops and numpy functions, comparing their performance.
