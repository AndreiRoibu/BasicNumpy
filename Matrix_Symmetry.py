'''Matrix Symmetry

Author: Andrei-Claudiu Roibu, 2019

This code has been created to compare the speed difference between a numpy dot product and a slow dot product. This code was written in support of my learning.

The original code comes from these two sources:

Description:

This code tests if a matrix is symmetric. This is done either manually, and using numpy functions.
